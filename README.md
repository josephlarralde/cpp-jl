# jl.cpp.lib

### a collection of audio related c++ classes and functions

This library is mostly a place where I put useful pieces of code from time to time,
as I develop them for various needs.
It is meant to be easy to integrate in various environments such as pure data or oFx.
It is an ongoing work, and I only put tested code here, which is why it's pretty minimal.

ATM I mostly use pure data as a host environment for these bits of code.
If you try to port them to other environments and encounter any issues related to
the design of the library, please let me know and I'll do my best to improve it.
